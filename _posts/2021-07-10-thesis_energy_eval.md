In the quest for sustainable yachting, accurately predicting energy consumption has been a persistent challenge. This is where my graduate project, awarded the **Maritime Designer of the Year 2022**, made a breakthrough by introducing a novel methodology to bridge the gap between predicted and actual energy usage. Leveraging **Grey-Box Modelling (GBM)**, my approach combined physics-based White-Box Models (WBM) and data-driven Black-Box Models (BBM) to deliver unprecedented accuracy and insights.

#### Key Highlights of the Project

1. **Real Operational Data Utilization**: 
   Using 10 months of voyage data from a Feadship yacht, coupled with weather and voyage details, the model achieved prediction errors of just **3% for propulsion power** and **7% for auxiliary power** under real-world conditions.

2. **Innovative Methodology**:
   - Developed a **sequential modelling process** integrating WBMs for different power components.
   - Utilized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to scale predictions for operational conditions.
   - Created modular frameworks adaptable to various maritime applications.

3. **Advantages of Grey-Box Modelling**:
   - **Improved Accuracy**: Outperformed both standalone WBMs and BBMs in prediction reliability.
   - **Better Extrapolation**: Retained critical physical dynamics, enhancing performance in unseen scenarios.
   - **Adaptability**: Modular design accommodated multiple data types and operational profiles.

#### Why This Matters

The maritime industry's push toward sustainability demands tools that align design predictions with operational realities. My research demonstrated that combining physics-based insights with data-driven models not only boosts prediction accuracy but also provides a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns.

#### Looking Ahead

This project paves the way for:
- **Sustainable Yacht Design**: Providing designers with reliable early-stage tools to optimize energy usage.
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Adapting the methodology for operational decision-making.
- **Scalable Applications**: Expanding to other vessels, ensuring broader industry adoption.

By bridging the gap between prediction and reality, this Grey-Box approach is a step toward greener, more efficient yachtingâ€”a critical need in our fight against climate change.
